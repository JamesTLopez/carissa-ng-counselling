                I am a Registered Psychotherapist and a graduate of Trinity
                Western University, where I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in
                Counselling Psychology. Over the past three years, I have worked
                at various community agencies, assessing and supporting clients
                with depression, anxiety, trauma experiences, chronic pain,
                identity issues, academic concerns, and relationship concerns.

                  I believe that every human deserves to have their story seen,
                  heard, and understood. This can be especially important in our
                  busy world where it can be difficult to take the time to slow
                  down and truly listen.
